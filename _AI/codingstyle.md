# Coding Rules

- **Never perform git commit, push, or other git commands automatically.** Only use safe commands such as diff or status when needed. All other git operations must be performed manually by the user.
- **Only make changes when clearly instructed.** If unsure, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- **Follow the current project style** (formatting, naming, structure). Use existing patterns and conventions as reference.
- **Focus on the current in-progress step** in \_AI/progress.md. Avoid unrelated changes or distractions.
- **Keep code comments minimal.** Only add comments when necessary to clarify non-obvious logic or prevent confusion. Do not comment on every small change.
- **Unit tests are required for each main feature or fix.** Tests should be committed together with the implementation.
- **TypeScript best practices:**
  - Avoid using the `any` type. Prefer strict typing and type inference.
  - Avoid using the `as` keyword for type assertions unless absolutely necessary.
  - Minimize or avoid the use of TypeScript/ESLint ignore comments (e.g., `// @ts-ignore`, `// eslint-disable-next-line`).
- **ESLint/code quality:**
  - When code smells or anti-patterns are detected, always consider and suggest appropriate ESLint rules to enforce better practices.
- **Error handling:**
  - Show user-friendly error messages for failed API calls or invalid input.
  - Use loading indicators for async operations.
- **Security:**
  - Never expose sensitive data in the frontend.
  - Always handle authentication tokens securely.
- **Keep the codebase clean:**
  - Remove unused code, imports, and variables.
  - Avoid duplicating logicâ€”reuse services and utilities where possible.
- **UI/UX:**
  - Ensure the app is usable and visually consistent.
  - Follow accessibility best practices where practical.
