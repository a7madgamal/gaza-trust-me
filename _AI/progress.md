# Production Web App Development Plan

## Document Update Guidelines

**Important:** When updating this document, maintain the hierarchical numbering system:

- Keep existing numbering for unchanged items
- When adding new items, insert them with appropriate numbering (e.g., if adding between 2.3 and 2.4, use 2.3.1, 2.3.2, etc., or renumber subsequent items)
- When removing items, update all subsequent numbering in that section
- Maintain consistent indentation levels for sub-items

## About This File

This document tracks the progress of building the help-seeking platform. As we complete each task, we'll check off the corresponding checkbox (`- [ ]` â†’ `- [x]`) to maintain a clear view of what's been accomplished and what remains to be done. This helps maintain project momentum and provides a comprehensive overview of the development status.

when asked to implement a point, try to stick the point scope as possible
