## Technical Debt & Improvements Needed

### Backend

- ✅ **Fixed authentication flow and error handling**
- ✅ **Implemented proper tRPC middleware**
- ✅ **Supabase types tightly integrated with tRPC** - Single endpoint converted as proof of concept
- ✅ **Complete tRPC type integration** - All routers now use generated Supabase types
- 🔄 Replace REST endpoints with tRPC for consistency
- 🔄 Add comprehensive error handling
- 🔄 Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- 🔄 Add input sanitization and XSS protection
- 🔄 Create audit logging for all actions

### Frontend

- ✅ **Added authentication error handling and auto-logout**
- ✅ **Fixed session management**
- ✅ **E2E test type safety** - Tests now use generated Supabase types
- ✅ **E2E test RLS bypass** - Service role key for test user creation
- 🔄 Add loading states for all async operations
- 🔄 Implement proper error boundaries
- 🔄 Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- 🔄 Optimize bundle size and performance
- 🔄 Add unit tests for components

### Database

- 🔄 Add missing indexes for performance
- 🔄 Create backup and recovery procedures

## Next Priority: Complete Admin Action Logging

**Tasks:**

1. ✅ Implement admin authentication and role-based access control
2. ✅ Create admin dashboard for user review and management
3. ✅ Build user verification/flagging workflow
4. ✅ **Add audit logging** - Trigger function creates audit_logs entries
5. 🚧 **Add admin action logging** - Actions not recorded in admin_actions table
6. 🚧 Implement super admin user role management

**Success:**

- ✅ Admins can review and verify user profiles
- ✅ **Audit trail for user status changes** - audit_logs table captures all updates
- ❌ Super admins can manage user roles and system settings
- ✅ Secure role-based access control

**Current Gap:** Admin actions update user status and create audit logs, but don't log to `admin_actions` table
