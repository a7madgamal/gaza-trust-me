## Development Workflow

### ‚ùå **PowerShell Command Syntax**

- **Problem:** Used `&&` operator in PowerShell (not supported)
- **Correct:** Use separate commands or `;` separator
- **Lesson:** Always use Windows-compatible commands

### ‚ùå **Type Assertions & User Preferences**

- **Problem:** Used `as` and `any` when user prefers Zod
- **User Preference:** "i prefer zod when suitable instead"
- **Lesson:** Use Zod for runtime validation, avoid `as` and `any`

### ‚úÖ **Incremental Refactoring**

- **Approach:** Broke down large refactoring into smaller, testable steps
- **Lesson:** Incremental changes reduce risk and improve debugging

### ‚ùå **Unnecessary Comments**

- **Problem:** Added verbose comments that don't add real value
- **User Preference:** "avoid comments unless really needed and adding real value"
- **Lesson:** Only comment non-obvious logic, let code speak for itself

### üö® **NEVER Touch Generated Files**

- **Problem:** Manually editing Supabase-generated types
- **Rule:** `GENERATED_database.types.ts` is auto-generated by Supabase CLI
- **Setup:** `npm run types:generate` generates and formats the file automatically
- **Lesson:** Only modify files you create, never touch generated files - they'll be overwritten

### ‚ùå **Don't Run Dev Servers**

- **Problem:** Tried to run dev servers automatically
- **Rule:** Always assume servers are running
- **Lesson:** Don't run dev servers - if they're not running, ask the user

### üö® **NEVER Skip Tests Without Confirmation**

- **Problem:** Skipped tests when stuck instead of asking user
- **Rule:** Always ask before skipping tests - user may have preferences
- **Lesson:** When stuck, ask user how to proceed rather than skipping tests
